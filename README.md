## Section 1
I am an economics major taking my second of three 300-level economics electives. I have had very
little exposure to digital and computational science and thus my knowledge of coding, which is an
ever more important skill, is limited to Stata and some C from an introductory high school class.
When it comes to what I may want to do for my project for this class, I look ahead to what I want
to write my thesis on. I have been very aware of my privilege to attend a well-ranked high school
and college, and I appreciate that education plays one of the most significant roles in personal
outcomes. My econometrics course ran regressions and found that the level of education attained
(among other factors contributing to educational experience) was the most significant determinant
of the ”success” of populations of people we studied. In my Women in Developing Economics
class, we looked at economic/municipal policies that were put in place as an attempt to make
education more accessible for women in developing countries, especially China and India where
violence towards women, missing women, and unequal opportunities is most prevalent. Here, we
saw that when women had better access to education, they married later, attained higher paying
jobs, and lived longer which not only benefits them but following generations of women because
their intrinsic ”value” increases as it is viewed by parents. Thus, I have chosen to take a class
on perspectives in education and this big data class to better educate myself on the educational
system and how to manage large data sets and I hope to do a preliminary project relating to this
as my final project. Finally, my plan for after graduation is to enter financial services, preferably
in Financial Planning Analysis or other fields that expose me to financial models, risk assessment,
wealth management, data analysis etc.
